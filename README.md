# Designer Mac Setup

The purpose of this repo is to ease the mac setup process for new designers in a company.

I thought it could help other design teams, so I made it public.

## Getting started
All you have to do is to follow these simple steps. 

It requires to use your Terminal application (you can use iTerm too).

#### **Install Homebrew**

Homebrew is a popular package manager built for OS X.

Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

#### **Install Homebrew Cask**

Homebrew Cask is an extension for Homebrew that allows you to automate the installation of Mac applications and fonts.

To install it, execute that command:

```bash
brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
```

#### **Install applications**

We have a bash script called [`apps.sh`](https://github.com/fgosselin/designer-mac-setup/blob/master/scripts/apps.sh) that will install the applications listed below on your mac.

To proceed to the installation, execute that command in your CLI:
```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fgosselin/designer-mac-setup/master/scripts/apps.sh | bash
```
